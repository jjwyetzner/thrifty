## Inspiration
Thrifting has become very mainstream, in part because of its environmental impact. However, with online shopping becoming the norm, it can be hard for thrift shops to compete. Thrifty gives these stores an online presence. In short, Thrifty attempts to solve two problems by providing an online marketplace experience: marketing for the stores and enhanced thrifting for customers.
## What it does
Thrifty is an e-commerce platform for thrift shops to sync their inventory online. Customers are able to view inventories online just like with any other platform. By typing the name of an item, customers are greeted with postings from many nearby thrift stores. This allows thrift stores to compete with other online shops and provide customers with a more sustainable option for shopping.
## How we built it
Thrifty uses a MongoDB database and is run on a reactJS web app.
## Challenges we ran into
We weren't familiar with using databases before this project.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our website UI/UX is very satisfying to the eye. We are also particularly proud of the environmental impact this could bring.
## What we learned
We learned a lot about full-stack development.
## What's next for Thrifty
We hope to expand Thrifty to actual thrift stores.
